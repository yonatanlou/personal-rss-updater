Reorganize this messy repository with the following structure rules:
- make sure each function have usage, if not, remove it
- too long function should be divided to a smaller one
- Maximum 5 code files per folder
- File length cannot be too long (maximum 250 lines). if it too long divide with smart logic (grouping similar functionalities together)
- Use hierarchical tree structure (no flat organization)
- No loose files - everything must be in appropriate folders
- Group related functionality together
- Create logical folder hierarchies based on purpose/domain
- Separate source code, tests, docs, and config files into distinct areas
- Use consistent naming conventions (lowercase, kebab-case for folders)
- Move utility/helper functions to dedicated common/utils folders
- Organize by feature/domain first, then by file type
- Ensure build artifacts, dependencies, and temp files are properly ignored
- Maintain import/dependency relationships and update paths accordingly
